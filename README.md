The dataset contains historical records of global greenhouse gas emissions across various commodities, including coal, oil, natural gas, and cement. This project's primary goal is to investigate emissions trends over time and understand the relationship between production levels and emissions for specific commodities. It seeks to provide insights into how industrialization and commodity-specific activities contribute to emissions and how these patterns evolve. 
 
The analysis focuses on the following key variables:
•	year: Observation year.
•	commodity: Type of commodity (e.g., coal, oil).
•	total_emissions_MtCO2e: Total emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
•	production_value: Production value by commodity.

Two key questions guide this analysis:
1.	What are the trends in global emissions over time, and how do different commodities contribute to total emissions?
2.	What is the relationship between production levels and emissions for specific commodities, and how does this vary across commodity types?

The findings will help quantify commodity-specific contributions to emissions and identify potential policy targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
