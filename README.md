## Global Emission Trends! & Production & Emission by Commodity


The dataset contains historical records of global greenhouse gas emissions across various commodities, including coal, oil, natural gas, and cement. This project's primary goal is to investigate emissions trends over time and understand the relationship between production levels and emissions for specific commodities. It seeks to provide insights into how industrialization and commodity-specific activities contribute to emissions and how these patterns evolve. 
 
The analysis focuses on the following key variables:
•	year: Observation year.
•	commodity: Type of commodity (e.g., coal, oil).
•	total_emissions_MtCO2e: Total emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
•	production_value: Production value by commodity.

Two key questions guide this analysis:
1.	What are the trends in global emissions over time, and how do different commodities contribute to total emissions?
2.	What is the relationship between production levels and emissions for specific commodities, and how does this vary across commodity types?

The findings will help quantify commodity-specific contributions to emissions and identify potential policy targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Conclusions

•	Global Trends and Commodity Contributions: The analysis of global emissions trends highlights a consistent increase over time, with coal historically dominating emissions. However, oil and natural gas contributions have grown significantly in recent decades, likely due to industrial expansion and increased energy demands. While smaller in scale, cement emissions are rising in developing regions as infrastructure projects expand. These findings emphasize the dynamic nature of commodity contributions to global emissions and the shifting energy landscape driven by economic and industrial growth.

•	Production-Emission Relationship: As the interaction analysis demonstrates, the relationship between production levels and emissions varies significantly across commodities. Commodities like coal and oil exhibit higher emissions per unit of production than natural gas and cement, highlighting their outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. This reinforces the importance of tailoring mitigation strategies to specific commodity characteristics rather than adopting uniform approaches.

•	Logical Link Between Questions: The insights from both questions provide a cohesive narrative. While global trends show the evolving contributions of commodities to emissions, the production-emission relationship analysis delves deeper into explaining the mechanisms behind these trends. The interaction effects indicate that the production scale alone does not fully account for emissions; commodity-specific factors play a crucial role. For example, despite the recent plateau in global emissions growth, rising oil and natural gas production continues to offset potential reductions from cleaner technologies.

•	Policy Implications: Addressing global emissions effectively requires a macro-level understanding of historical and current trends (Question 1) and a micro-level focus on production-emission relationships (Question 2). Policies should target high-emission commodities like coal and oil with stricter regulations and incentives for cleaner alternatives while leveraging advancements in lower-emission commodities like natural gas and cement to achieve overall reductions.
